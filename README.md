# gtkGopher

A simple gtk gopher client, that will eventually support other protocols
Codename: dragonstone

## What this currenty is
Short answer: not finished!
Long answer:
A simple gtk based gopher client written in vala,
that will eventually support other protocols
Note: This is not only my first gtk but also my first vala project

You could also market it as a browser, that truely respects your privacy

### What can it do?
-fetch files from gopher servers (mostly successful)
-display content in multiple tabs
-display gopher directorys
-display text files
-display unscaled images
-some basic error handling

### What can it NOT do?
-save files to disk
-display any menues (not my #1 priority right now, but I'll add them soon)
-talk with anything that is not a gopher server
-open http and mailto links in a browser/mail client

## TODO:
-Implement a resource store, that can route requests to other protocol specific stores
-Implement a way to download things
-Implement dynamic tabs (basically what you knnow from your web browser)
