alecaddd [LBRY] - for the amazing vala tutorial series
rain-1 [github] - for his simple gopher client, I used as a reference
baschdel [gitlab] - for Dragonstone making this browser possible
Everyone who made gtk and vala a thing, beacause otherwise this if at all would have been written in python or java
